You’ve been losing a lot of socks in the laundry lately, so you hop on to Macys.com to alleviate the problem.  You add a couple pairs to your cart, totaling $10, maybe $12.  When you hit the checkout button, however, you are startled to realize that your $10 order is about to cost you an extra $10 in shipping.  Frustrated, you drop the purchase.  
The Milkman is a web service that seeks to address this problem.  By taking advantage of localized, high-volume shopping networks of people living with a centralized mailing location, such as Princeton University or an apartment building, the Milkman allows users to aggregate their online purchases into a mega-order that meets the retailer-set minimum for free shipping. The users pay for their purchases via Paypal and The Milkman will create and submit the mega-order for shipment to one of users. The Milkman is a win-win-win service that enables free shipping, increased retail purchase volume, and reduced material waste through more efficient packaging and shipping. 
Going into this project, our team had little experience with web design. While Pranav had the most experience, Ginny had none, and Capella was somewhere in the middle, we had a steep amount of work ahead of us to get acquainted with web design. Thus, the first few weeks of the project consisted of figuring out how to integrate the different pieces of code, how to share code amongst ourselves, how to get a working database up, and other simple functionality issues. One of the best pieces of advice we received came from Chris Moretti who told us to get a simple functioning app up on Heroku, with an integrated front and back end, then reiterate and develop from both ends. Indeed, integrating all of our site’s components (Heroku, PostgreSQL database, Flask, Python, Bootstrap, and Git/Github) was a formidable challenge and because we underestimated the difficulty of integration, we fell behind schedule in the first few weeks. However, we ultimately found this very helpful as we didn’t have to worry about fitting the ends together in the end (as many of peer groups did), and were instead able to specialize on frontend/backend from the beginning and focus on the exciting parts of our website.
Another lesson learned was the importance of storyboarding and sharing a common vision for the website from the beginning. Before ever starting any coding, we sat down together and sketched out exactly what we wanted our website to look like. The two images below are from our storyboarding session in March:   
Our final product is actually remarkably similar to our original storyboarded ideas. Planning the overall look and feel of the website was particularly useful in terms of specialization, because even Pranav, who focused on the backend, knew how his code would be displayed.
On the note of specialization, we also feel that we delegated tasks appropriately. In particular, Ginny focused on frontend development, Pranav focused on the backend, and Capella bridged the two and worked on the business logic. Of course, we were all aware of each other’s software development and did work outside our specialties on numerous occasions. However, specializing enabled us to become experts in niche areas and paralleled actual industry software development, which tends to be highly specialized.
One area we did not execute very well was hitting our milestones. Strangely enough it wasn’t that we fell behind and had to play catch up (as would be expected). In fact, we accomplished virtually everything that we wanted to and never had to cram an unreasonable amount of work into a short period of time. The issue was rather that when setting our milestones, we roughly guessed what we thought we would have wanted to accomplish by those dates. None of us really grasped which milestones were doable in the given amount of time and which were more difficult. As it turned out, the intial set-up took by far the longest amount of time. After we had integrated the pieces (as Chris had suggested) it was very easy to reiterate over them and make changes. Thus, once we had the set-up down, we saw changes occur relatively quickly. We recommend that future 333-ers be aware that they will most likely hit set-backs at first, but once getting past those, the site will develop quickly. So they should allow for the most time with the set-up in the beginning.
An area that worked well for us was Beta testing. While we didn’t get to start Beta testing as early as we had originally scheduled in our milestones, we were able to make up for it in volume of beta testers. Because The Milkman is directly targeted at college students, we were able to recruit Ginny’s volleyball teammates, Ginny & Capella’s sorority sisters, friends, and roommates as testers. Our testers found several bugs and issues that we would not have found on our own. For instance, a tester reported that the “ship to me” option was confusing, and we should add an explanation. Thus, we added the  “?” button for help in the order form. Another tester later found that this button was not working under some specific circumstances and we were able to fix the bug the morning of our demo. Our testers also provided feedback on soft-issues like wording of our instructions and the overall website aesthetics. Overall, we received extremely positive feedback about the website, although we reworded and redesigned many components to reflect user suggestions.
Of course, we also learned countless lessons from doing things wrong the first time. For example, our product’s name was something that we failed to pin down from the start. Initially, we had called our website “Baggregate”, a portmanteau of Bag and Aggregate. However, Mr. John Wheeran (Shirley Tilghman’s speechwriter) pointed out that the name was too long and had resemblance to the -gate scandal suffix (e.g. Watergate). Accordingly, we renamed our product to “Roo”, short for kangaroo, which has a pouch/bag. While Roo was a short and sweet name, we realized that it didn’t directly convey anything about what our product does. Finally, we changed the name to “The Milkman” which was suggested by Chris Moretti during a weekly meeting.  The name perfectly embodied the central core of our service: friendly, reliable, and a neighborhood staple.  We thought of how milkmen used to deliver milk bottles weekly to neighborhoods, aggregating the work together for maximized efficiency.  This was exactly what we sought to do, and The Milkman was therefore a perfect fit! However, we made the mistake of hard coding our project name throughout the software. For example, when we switched the site name from Roo to The Milkman the day before the final presentation, we had to spend several hours fixing the web page names and modifying the Facebook permission urls. Even now, the database models are centered around Bag objects, which we now call Crates. If we had put more thought into naming earlier or had at least realized that the name was likely to change, we could have saved a lot of time later in the project.
We also made the mistake of postponing complete Github integration till about midway into the project. We had intended to fully do this early on in the project, but failed to figure it out until Chris pointed us to a highly instructive tutorial for Github at try.github.com,. Subsequently, we all began pushing to Github for code management and pushing to Heroku for deployment. Using Github was a night and day change from what we had done prior: copy and pasting code messily into emails. With Github, we were finally able to work remotely and independently when our schedules did not match, and our project progress quickened dramatically after setting up Github. So we certainly wish we had figured out Github earlier. Also, we have still struggled with some of the “intermediate” features in revision control. For example, we often have to destructively merge changes when we push and pull. We will definitely iron out these issues prior to continuing project development. 
Another area for improvement is local testing. During the week that we initially set up our Heroku application, Heroku completely changed its tutorials and documentation! Consequently, there was no clear documentation for setting up local testing for our app (although we’re sure it’s not too difficult with some StackOverflow searching...). Instead, we chose to always push to Heroku to test our code. In retrospect, this was a bad decision that cost us several hours because each Heroku push took close to a minute. Especially when we wanted to change one or two small features like rendering, we had to upload all of the changes onto Heroku. Setting up local testing will definitely be a priority before we proceed with further development.
Finally, we also also regret not creating a template structure for our frontend. Originally, we had five layouts for our pages, in which case, it seemed like having a template structure was not worth the overhead. However, we eventually learned that we needed many more html files to support all the features we needed. One thing that we should have done differently was to create a base html template for all of our pages. Because we failed to do so, every time we changed something such as default font or the navigation bar at the top of the page, we had to edit every single html document, which became somewhat frustrating later on.
We intend to continue working on The Milkman, and we’d like to take it further than the Princeton network. After testing out The Milkman on Princeton’s campus (perhaps as a TigerApp), we would like to make it possible to join networks outside of Princeton (other college campuses, apartment buildings, etc.) or even to create your own network among your Facebook friends. Ideally, we will implement these changes after working out the kinks on Princeton’s campus, and hopefully turn The Milkman into a legitimate business. As we mentioned during the presentation, we have several possible monetization schemes: feature bags on the main page, advertisements targeted at users who are about to make a purchase, and nominal fees charged to users for joining a crate.
If we were to give advice to future COS 333 students, we would definitely tell them to put lots of time and effort into their site. You’ll hit road bumps that you had never even thought of, and it is nice to allow time for overcoming them. Furthermore, regardless of whether it is a very simple website or something that is going to revolutionize the internet, it will turn into your “baby.” When you put a lot of work and effort into it, and in the end you see this functioning website, you will be happy to know that “wow, we created this.” You can send the link to your friends and family, which is really exciting, and you become very proud of your website. The more work you put into the site, the prouder you’ll be. Plus, it is just a really cool to see the transformation and development of your website over time.
We would like to thank Professor Kernighan for a fantastic class. COS 333 gave us the tools and inspiration to take The Milkman from an idea in the back of our minds to a product that could actually become a commercial success. We are also extremely grateful to Chris Moretti, our TA.
