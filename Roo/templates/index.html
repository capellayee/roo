<P>As shipping and handling fees are one of the most significant causes of dropped purchases online (something we have all personally experienced and been frustrated by), The Milkman is mutually beneficial to both seller and shipper. By integrating through Facebook, thereby inheriting networking capabilities, The Milkman allows local friends to aggregate their online shipping purchases to meet the minimum for free shipping and avoid the shipping fee. Additionally, the service reduces shipping waste and traffic through aggregation. 
Shoppers are able to create their own network of people to join a "crate" (purchases from the same site). In this way, users can control who they enter the free shipping with, providing a feeling of mutual trust and security. This also allows for users to have flexibility in their crates. 

<P> How to access or create a running version of your system.

<P> Contact the project leader, Pranav Gokhale, at pgokhale@princeton.edu if something goes wrong.

<p> The elevator speech description goes here.

</p><p> How to access or create a running version of your system.
If your system is web-based, this should be a URL.
If your system is stand-alone on some public or private machine, we
need to be able to access it on that machine.  
If your system is a phone application,
this should reference an installable version.
Don't forget passwords, including administrative access, if we will need them.

</p><p> Who to contact in case something goes wrong.

</p><blockquote>
<p> <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring13/cos333/a-link-to-your-project-web-page"> Your project's web page</a>
or home page or the like: the place to find all public information
about your project.
This may be the same link as the "how to access a running version"
page.

Please submit these as PDF or as a web page, not Powerpoint.
</p></blockquote>

<p> These links must point to either HTML
or PDF files with names like internals.html or internals.pdf.
They must not require logging in to some place like Google Docs.
My goal is to have the submissions be uniform at this level
so the TAs and I can access the pieces easily.

Thanks.
